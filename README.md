research questions

Question 1:  
How do hospital services prices cluster and do they form natural pricing tiers?

Question 2: 
Can we build a model to predict a negotiated rate for a given procedure for a given payer at a given hospital? (train with a random 90% of Hospital A pricing data, test on the remaining 10%) 

Question 3: 
If we add multiple hospitals, demographic, population, and/or market data to the training set, can the model predict negotiated rates at other hospitals?
